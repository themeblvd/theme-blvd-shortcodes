This plugin works in conjuction with the Theme Blvd framework to create shortcodes for many of the framework's internal elements.

== Description ==

Within the Theme Blvd framework there are many internal elements and other 3rd party items like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) integration to make use of.  When using a Theme Blvd theme, this plugin gives you an extensive pack of shortcodes to extend the framework's functionality to your pages, posts, and custom layouts via shortcodes.

After activating this plugin, you'll know it's ready to go by viewing the Edit Page or Edit Post screen and seeing the plugin's [shortcode generator](http://shortcodes.themeblvd.com/generator) button above your WordPress Editor. You'll then have access to the following shortcodes for use within your website.

= Buttons =

Use Twitter Bootstrap's button styling along with tons of additional color options added by the Theme Blvd framework.

= Columns =

The column shortcodes allow you to structure your content into rows of various size columns within your pages and posts.

= Components =

Thanks to Twitter Bootstrap integration, this group of shortcodes adds some extra goodies for your website.

= Display Posts =

This group of shortcodes allow you to utilize the Theme Blvd framework's extensive system for displaying posts in both grid and list format.

= Image Icons =

An oldie, but a classic; use this shortcode to display any of the image icons bundled with the Theme Blvd framework.

= Inline Elements =

This group of shortcodes include some classic inline items like labels, icon links, text highlighting, the drop cap, and the newly added vector icon shortcode to take advantage of FontAwesome integration.

= Sliders =

When using the [Theme Blvd Sliders](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-blvd-sliders/) plugin, you've already got access to the `[slider]` shortcode. However, in addition to that you'll also get a fancy post grid slider and post list slider.

= Gallery Slider =

In a similar way that you'd create a typical WordPress gallery, you can create a quick slider of images from your media library.

= Tabs & Toggles =

The Theme Blvd shortcodes pack wouldn't be complete without the ability create slick jQuery content control via tabs and toggles.

= Lightbox =

Theme Blvd themes already come with basic lightbox integration, and this plugin will give you a `[lightbox]` shortcode you can use to easily tap into this. You can also wrap a group of `[lightbox]` instances in a `[lightbox_gallery]` for them to be grouped into a gallery within the lightbox.

Additionally, there is a featured called "Auto Lightbox" which will automatically convert images inserted into pages and posts into the `[lightbox]` shortcode when they link to a lightbox-compatible URL. Note that you can disable this functionality from *Settings > Writing* in your WordPress admin.

= Raw Shortcode =

Any content wrapped in the `[raw]` shortcode will allow you to escape any automatic WordPress formatting. Keep in mind that this is not a standard shortcode, and does modify the content outputted in your site. So, if you find that this conflicts with any other plugins you may be using, you can disable this functionality all together from *Settings > Writing* in your WordPress admin.

**NOTE: For this plugin to do anything, you must have a theme with Theme Blvd framework v2.2+ activated.**
