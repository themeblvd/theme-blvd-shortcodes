This plugin works in conjuction with the Theme Blvd framework to create shortcodes for many of the framework's internal elements.

== Description ==

Within the Theme Blvd framework there are many internal elements and other 3rd party items like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) integration to make use of.  When using a Theme Blvd theme, this plugin gives you an extensive pack of shortcodes to extend the framework's functionality to your pages, posts, and custom layouts via shortcodes.

After activating this plugin, you'll know it's ready to go by viewing the Edit Page or Edit Post screen and seeing the plugin's [shortcode generator](http://shortcodes.themeblvd.com/generator) within your Visual Editor. You'll then have access to the following shortcodes for use within your website.

= Alerts & Info Boxes =

These shortcodes provide you with a quick way to inform your readers of important information within a post or page.

= Buttons =

Use Twitter Bootstrap's button styling along with tons of additional color options added by the Theme Blvd framework.

= Sliders =

When using the [Theme Blvd Sliders](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-blvd-sliders/) plugin, you've already got access to the `[slider]` shortcode. However, in addition to that you'll also get a fancy post grid slider and post list slider.

= Small Components =

Thanks to Twitter Bootstrap integration, this group of shortcodes adds some extra goodies for your website.

= Tabs & Toggles =

The Theme Blvd shortcodes pack wouldn't be complete without the ability create slick jQuery content control via tabs and toggles.

= Raw Shortcode =

Any content wrapped in the `[raw]` shortcode will allow you to escape any automatic WordPress formatting. Keep in mind that this is not a standard shortcode, and does modify the content outputted in your site. So, if you find that this conflicts with any other plugins you may be using, you can disable this functionality all together from *Settings > Writing* in your WordPress admin.

**NOTE: For this plugin to do anything, you must have a theme with Theme Blvd framework v2.2+ activated.**
